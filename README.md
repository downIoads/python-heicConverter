# python-heicConverter
Simple script to batch convert HEIC to PNG

## Why does this exist?
Modern smartphones are likely to store images as .HEIC and Microsoft does not seem to care. They offer "HEIF image extensions" on the Microsoft Store which you have to manually search and install and then they note that in order for this to work you must also BUY "HEVC Video Extensions" for $0.99. All of this just to be able to view a .HEIC image on your computer, I can not believe this. First of all, how is this this standard functionality and then second of all why would you make this process so complicated and then third of all why would you paywall this??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
